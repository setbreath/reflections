When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to collaborate with other people on the same projects, I would rather choose to use a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Cause there may be some part of my work I don't want them to be public or the last commit is not a reliable version I just don't wish anyone to get it until I fix all the bugs or resolve any left problems.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

branches are local labels for different commit to classify your work for different purpose. Clone cmd copy the remote or local repository to a local directory. Fork cmd copies other's repository on GitHub to your own space and create a same name repository. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It helps to keep track of the latest feature so all the development could try to compatible with or even take advantage of the core stable version.
